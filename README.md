# nV-Physics-SDK
That's the first Egyptian/Arabian Physics Engine, it was programmed by Khayal IE by Mustafa Ashour and Ahmed El Deeb, and was used in a egyptian game called "Abo7adeed" and it failed in sales, and the company bankrupted in 2008 or 2009, i guess.
I think it was mainly programmed in C, and it was published in 2006 as a beta, and it's the only available public release of it, and there isn't any main release copy of it, on the internet atleast, so i guess it's lost to time.
So i archived it, and i know it would be useless for today's standards, but i loved to save it from time.

Disclaimer : I do not claim owning or programming this piece of software, and i only archived it because it was under public release.

If the original programmers want this page to get down, Contact xmodypc@gmail.com
