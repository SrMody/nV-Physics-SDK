# nV-Physics-SDK
This Is The First Egyptian-Arabian Physics Engine It Was Programmed By Khayal Interactive Entertainement 
This Is Just A Beta Because There Isn't Any Public Release For The Engine The File Contain The SDK With 2 Demos Programmed With The SDK 
I Don't Own The Engine And I Publish This File Because The Company Got Bankrupted In 2009 And The Last Project For The Company Was A Game Named Abo Hadeed(Boha)
